      "paragraph1": "If you live near the Welland Canal, you know the frustration. You're running late, you hit the bridge, and the bridge is up. No idea how long you'll be waiting.",
      "paragraph2": "The official Seaway website exists, but it's clunky and not something you can safely check while driving. They've been promising a redesign for years. They eventually added Google and Waze integration, but in practice it's slow and unreliable. I wanted something I could actually glance at on CarPlay.",

      "a2": "Bridge Up is a passion project. I built it because I was tired of getting stuck at bridges myself. My costs are minimal, so I'd rather make it free and useful for everyone.",
      "q3": "How accurate are the predictions?",
      "a3": "Our predictions use 95% confidence intervals based on the 300 most recent closures for each bridge. Most predictions are accurate within a few minutes. Keep in mind it's only an estimate using past closure data as a guide, meaning it can be wildly wrong at times.",
      "q4": "Do you support Android?",
      "a4": "Currently Bridge Up is iOS only, with full CarPlay support. Android support is on the roadmap for future development."
