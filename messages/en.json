      "paragraph2": "The official Seaway website exists, but it's clunky and not something you can safely check while driving. They've been promising a redesign for years. They eventually added Google and Waze integration, but in practice it's slow and unreliable. I wanted something I could actually glance at on CarPlay.",

      "q2": "How accurate are the predictions?",
      "a2": "Our predictions use 95% confidence intervals based on the 300 most recent closures for each bridge. Most predictions are accurate within a few minutes. Keep in mind it's only an estimate using past closure data as a guide, meaning it can be wildly wrong at times.",
      "q3": "Where does the boat tracking data come from?",
      "a3": "Boat tracking data comes from multiple sources. The primary source is a personal AIS antenna I operate in the St. Catharines region. Additional coverage is provided by AISHub, a community-run AIS database. This feature is new and the data sources are frequently changing. If you have an AIS setup in the Montreal region and would like to contribute data, please reach out!",
      "q4": "Do you support Android?",
      "a4": "Android is something I'll consider, but for now Bridge Up is available on web and iOS with full CarPlay support."
